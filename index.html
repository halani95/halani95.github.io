    <h1>Hannah Alani</h1>
<p>I'm a junior studying journalism and anthropology at <a href="https://www.indiana.edu/" target="_blank"> Indiana University</a>. I grew up in Bloomington, Ind. I studied abroad in London last summer and had a media internship. Two years from now, I'll be out of college and either pursuing professional work in media or attending graduate school. I love to travel. In another life, I am a naturualist who hunts and cultuvates wild herbs to make teas and medicines. My cat Arthur is by best friend.

    <h2>Reporter - Indiana Daily Student</h2>
    <p> This semester I am researching and reporting a couple different long-term narrative and investigative projects. I am working on a semester-long profile of an IU freshman whose sister was murdered on IU's campus last April, and will follow her story into the murder suspect's trial in February. I am working with a photographer and multimedia reporter to tell that story on multiple platforms. I'm working on a couple data-based investigative projects, including an analysis of last year's climate survey that IU administration created and used to assess sexual assault culture at IU. The results from the survey are affecting funding and planning of campus sexual assault programming and prevention. </p>

    <h2>Intern - EL Gazette - London </h2>
    <p> The EL Gazette is a monthly business-to-business newspaper based in East London. For two months, I researched and wrote stories relating to the English Language Teaching industry. I learned so much about the differences and similarites between US and UK media culture, and daily life. My coworkers in the small newsroom of Aldgate taught me about life in London, from squatting during the Thatcher days to lunchtime pints to the merits of socialized medicine. I would go back to London in a heartbeat! But never to work in oh-so-relevant tabloid industry. </p>

    <h2> Editor - Indiana Daily Student </h2>
    <p> In the spring semester of my sophomore year at IU, I was the Region Editor for the Indiana Daily Student. I oversaw the daily news content as well as some larger projects, such as comprehensive coverage of Gov. Mike Pence and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act controversy, and the daily breaking news coverage of the murder of an IU senior in late April. During my time as Region Editor, I was able to travel with another writer and photographer to report on President Obama's arrival in Indianapolis. Seeing him over the shoulders of the NYT and WaPo reporters in the White House Press Pool was one of the cooler accomplishments in my early career. </p>
